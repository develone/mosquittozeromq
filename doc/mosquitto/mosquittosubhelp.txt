       mosquitto_sub --help

 -A : bind the outgoing socket to this host/ip address. Use to control which interface
      the client communicates over.
 -c : disable 'clean session' (store subscription and pending messages when client disconnects).
 -C : disconnect and exit after receiving the 'msg_count' messages.
 -d : enable debug messages.
 -F : output format.
 -h : mqtt host to connect to. Defaults to localhost.
 -i : id to use for this client. Defaults to mosquitto_sub_ appended with the process id.
 -I : define the client id as id_prefix appended with the process id. Useful for when the
      broker is using the clientid_prefixes option.
 -k : keep alive in seconds for this client. Defaults to 60.
 -L : specify user, password, hostname, port and topic as a URL in the form:
      mqtt(s)://[username[:password]@]host[:port]/topic
 -N : do not add an end of line character when printing the payload.
 -p : network port to connect to. Defaults to 1883 for plain MQTT and 8883 for MQTT over TLS.
 -P : provide a password
 -q : quality of service level to use for the subscription. Defaults to 0.
 -R : do not print stale messages (those with retain set).
 -t : mqtt topic to subscribe to. May be repeated multiple times.
 -T : topic string to filter out of results. May be repeated.
 -u : provide a username
 -U : unsubscribe from a topic. May be repeated.
 -v : print published messages verbosely.
 -V : specify the version of the MQTT protocol to use when connecting.
      Can be mqttv31 or mqttv311. Defaults to mqttv311.
 -W : Specifies a timeout in seconds how long to process incoming MQTT messages.
 --help : display this message.
 --quiet : don't print error messages.
 --retained-only : only handle messages with the retained flag set, and exit when the
                   first non-retained message is received.
 --will-payload : payload for the client Will, which is sent by the broker in case of
                  unexpected disconnection. If not given and will-topic is set, a zero
                  length message will be sent.
 --will-qos : QoS level for the client Will.
 --will-retain : if given, make the client Will retained.
 --will-topic : the topic on which to publish the client Will.
 --cafile : path to a file containing trusted CA certificates to enable encrypted
            certificate based communication.
 --capath : path to a directory containing trusted CA certificates to enable encrypted
            communication.
 --cert : client certificate for authentication, if required by server.
 --key : client private key for authentication, if required by server.
 --ciphers : openssl compatible list of TLS ciphers to support.
 --tls-version : TLS protocol version, can be one of tlsv1.2 tlsv1.1 or tlsv1.
                 Defaults to tlsv1.2 if available.
 --insecure : do not check that the server certificate hostname matches the remote
              hostname. Using this option means that you cannot be sure that the
              remote host is the server you wish to connect to and so is insecure.
              Do not use this option in a production environment.
 --psk : pre-shared-key in hexadecimal (no leading 0x) to enable TLS-PSK mode.
 --psk-identity : client identity string for TLS-PSK mode.
 --proxy : SOCKS5 proxy URL of the form:
           socks5h://[username[:password]@]hostname[:port]
           Only "none" and "username" authentication is supported.
